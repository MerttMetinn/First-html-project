      Shawshank Redeems Hollywood Can Hollywood, usually creating things for
      entertainment purposes only, create art? To create something of this
      nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to
      the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely
      capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely
      developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most
      prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each
      equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious
      union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus.
      Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at
      writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film
      directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a
      master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most
      recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. The
      Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the
      emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to
      Hollywood.

      The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense,
      victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the
      murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds
      himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of
      parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free
      from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the
      gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis
      Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his
      entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in
      contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor
      and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself,
      and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in
      the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in
      his lifestyle.

      By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled
      screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes
      himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally
      noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this
      novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he
      dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though
      the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused
      objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short,
      resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.
    </p>

      While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella,
      Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of
      emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He employs the
      cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred
      Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing
      Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as
      if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman lends himself to individualism
      and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score
      composition. His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score
      received an Oscar nomination in 1995. While unique and independent,
      Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from
      the film.

      With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers,
      composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast
      of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with. The
      marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most
      convincing performances you will witness in a film. While both Tim Robbins
      and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle
      of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily
      disappear into their roles. Most noticeable of these, the veteran film
      star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man
      incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself
      attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these
      actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their
      motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to
      anything unbelievable.

      With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the
      most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as
      its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope
      and freedom. These themes, which concern things the human spirit
      undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it
      easily draws its audience in to its story. Though full of hardened
      criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most
      basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a
      film to date. Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater
      things than simply entertaining an audience. Darabont tells his story most
      masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think.
      He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and
      redemption, something we all seek.
    </p>

    <p>
      This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it
      long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us
      that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production
      facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art
      that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world
      around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh
      air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters
      of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless
      masterpieces that we will never forget.
